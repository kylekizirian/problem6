# problem6

This repo contains a notebook inspired by [this 3blue1brown
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkmNXy7er84&t=1s) which looks at question
A6 on the [1992 Putnam](http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~dale/putnam/1992.pdf) 

The question is ​
>Four points are chosen independently and at random on the surface of
>a sphere (using the uniform distribution). What is the probability
>that the center of the sphere lies inside the resulting tetrahedron?
​

We will look first look at this question in 2-dimensions, 
that question
​
>Three points are chosen independently and at random on the surface
>of a circle. What is the probability that the center of the circle
>lies inside the resulting triangle?
